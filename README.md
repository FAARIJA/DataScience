### Python Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository 
where I showcase the Python practices 
I have gained. 
You will find a collection of exercises 
and mini-projects that demonstrate my skills
and understanding of Python programming. 
Each practice represents a step in my learning journey
